Feature: Append a new rule in Perseo manager using cards from portal
  As a Perseo user
  I want to be able to append a new rule in Perseo manager using cards from portal
  so that they become more functional and useful

  @happy_path
  Scenario Outline: append a new rule in Perseo manager using card from portal with all cards
    Given Perseo manager is installed correctly to "append"
    And configured with tenant "my_tenant" and service "/my_service"
     # Sensor cards
    And create a sensor card of notUpdated type with id "card_1", verify interval "45", attribute name "temperature", max time without update "10" and connect to "card_2"
    And create a sensor card of id type, with id "card_2", identity id "room2" and connect to "card_3"
    And create a sensor card of type type, with "card_3", identity type "room",operator "DIFFERENT_TO" and connect to "card_4"
    And create a sensor card of value threshold type, with id "card_4", attribute name "temperature", operator "GREATER_THAN", data type "Quantity", parameter value "34" and connect to "card_5"
    And create a sensor card of attribute threshold type, with id "card_5", attribute name "temperature", operator "GREATER_THAN", data type "Quantity", attribute to refer "temperature_refer" and connect to "card_6"
    And create a sensor card of epl type with id "card_6", epl query "sdfsdfsd dfsdfsdf sdfsdfsdf" and connect to "card_7"
     # Action cards
    And create a action card of "SendEmailAction" type, with id "card_7", response "${device_latitude}${device_longitude}${measure.value}", parameters "erwer@sdfsf.com" and connect to "card_8"
    And create a action card of "SendSmsMibAction" type, with id "card_8", response "${device_latitude}${device_longitude}${measure.value}", parameters "123456789" and connect to "card_9"
    And create a action card of "updateAttribute" type, with id "card_9", response "DANGER", parameters "ALARM" and connect to "card_10"
     # Time cards
    And create a time card of time elapsed type, with id "card_10", interval "8" and connect to "card_11"
     # end cards
    When append a new rule name "<rule_name>", activate "1"
    Then I receive an "Created" http code
    And Validate that rule name is created successfully in db
    And delete a rule created
  Examples:
    | rule_name |
    | test_1    |

    And create a action card of "<action>" type, with id "card_7", response "<response>", parameters "<parameters>" and connect to "card_8"
    When append a new rule name "<rule_name>", activate "1"
    Then I receive an "Created" http code
    And Validate that rule name is created successfully in db
    And delete a rule created
  Examples:
    | rule_name | action           | response                                              | parameters      |

    | test020   | SendSmsMibAction | ${device_latitude}${device_longitude}${measure.value} | 123456789       |

  Scenario Outline: append a new rule in Perseo manager using card from portal using value threshold, id, type cards and actions cards
    Given Perseo manager is installed correctly to "append"
    And configured with tenant "my_tenant" and service "/my_service"
    And create a sensor card of value threshold type, with id "card_4", attribute name "temperature", operator "GREATER_THAN", data type "Quantity", parameter value "34" and connect to "card_5"
    And create a sensor card of id type, with id "card_2", identity id "room2" and connect to "card_3"
    And create a sensor card of type type, with "card_3", identity type "room",operator "DIFFERENT_TO" and connect to "card_4"
