Feature: Launch an action if a rule is triggered in Perseo manager
    As a Perseo user
    I want to be able to launch a action (sms, email or update) if a rule is triggered in Perseo manager
    so that they become more functional and useful

    @happy_path
    Scenario Outline: launch a action if a rule is triggered in Perseo manager
       Given Perseo manager is installed correctly to "send"
         And configured with tenant "default" and service "default"
         And an EPL with a rule name "<rule_name>", an identity type "room", an attributes Number "default", an attribute data type "default", an operation type "default" and value "1.5"
         And append a new rule with a rule type "<rule_type>", a template "<template_info>" and a parameters "<parameters>"
         And an identity_id "room2", with attribute number "4", attribute name "attrName" and attribute type "celcius"
        When receives a notification with attributes value "300", metadata value "True" and content "json"
        Then I receive an "OK" http code
         And Validate that rule is triggered successfully
         And delete a rule created
    Examples:
        |rule_name  |rule_type  |template_info |parameters              |
        |SMS____name|sms        | (SMS rule)   |123456789               |
        |EMAIL__name|email      | (Email rule) |aaaaaaa@bbbbbb.ccc      |
        |update_name|update     |              |warning                 |
        |post___name|post       | (post rule)  |url - mock in localhost |


    @multiples_rules
    Scenario Outline: launch several actions if several rules are triggered in Perseo manager

         And configured with tenant "default" and service "default"
         And reset counters in mock "<rule_type>"
         And an EPL with a rule name "rules", an identity type "default", an attributes Number "default", an attribute data type "default", an operation type "default" and value "default"
         And create "<rule_number>" rules with prefix "<prefix_name>" and "<rule_type>" type
         And an identity_id "room2", with attribute number "4", attribute name "attrName" and attribute type "celcius"
        When receives a notification with attributes value "300", metadata value "True" and content "json"
        Then I receive an "OK" http code
         And Validate that all rules are triggered successfully
         And delete all rules created
       Examples:
        |rule_number|prefix_name|rule_type|
        |1          |prefix_1   |sms      |
